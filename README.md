Description: 
  
  What are you trying to build?:
    A GUI application that allows users to track income and expenses while displaying a chart to visualize and set financial 		goals.

Why do you want to build it?:
    we want to build it to aid in visualizing spending habits and estimating net growth or set goals for growth.

What will it be useful for?:
    It will be useful for visualizing spending habits and setting goals for future reference.

How will it be used?:
    It will be used as a Java application to calculate finances instead of doing the calculation/ visualization on your own.

Plan and estimate effort:
    The plan is to begin building the backend for the application, and then the GUI to be able to use the Java file to display the methods within the class to allow the user to interact with the application. We may split the backend and GUI assisting each other when necessary.
